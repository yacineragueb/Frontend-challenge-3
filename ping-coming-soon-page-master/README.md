## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

### What I learned

28/02/2025

Time has really flown by since the start of the new year, and with success from Allah, here I am completing the last challenge from the "newbie" level on Frontend Mentor. I wish I could have solved them all, but unfortunately, I donâ€™t have the money for that ðŸ˜‚.

Even though these challenges are simple, they have taught me a lot of things I didnâ€™t know and have improved my understanding and experience in building websites and designs using HTML, CSS, and JS. Not to mention one of the most popular CSS frameworks, Tailwindâ€”it has been one of the best things Iâ€™ve learned at the beginning of this new year.

I wonâ€™t deny that I was a bit confused when I first started learning and applying it, but with continuous practice and thanks to these challenges, I can now build even the most complex designs with ease and make them fully responsive on all devices.

What I want to say is: donâ€™t give up, my friend! Never abandon your goal, no matter how small your progress may seem. Donâ€™t let yourself get discouragedâ€”just keep going, and youâ€™ll see results that will truly amaze you. You never fail until you stop trying.

Iâ€™d also like to thank everyone who joined me on this journey, especially the Frontend Mentor community! ðŸ‘Œ

### Continued development

Even though I have completed these challenges, this is just the beginning. I will continue learning, exploring, and mastering new techniques. Now, I am moving on to the Junior-level challenges. ðŸš€
